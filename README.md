## Dependencies
### [Spicetify](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-cli)
The extension PopupLyrics is based on the Spicetify-cli.

Spicetify installation steps are below (see [Spicetify docs](https://spicetify.app/docs/getting-started) for more details).
#### Windows
```iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spicetify/spicetify-cli/master/install.ps1 | iex```
#### Linux and MacOS
```curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spicetify/spicetify-cli/master/install.sh | sh```

### [Netease API](https://github.com/Binaryify/NeteaseCloudMusicApi)
An [online deployed version](https://netease-cloud-music-api-patrick-orz.vercel.app/) is used by default.

If you would like to **self-host** for a more stable api connection, instructions are below (see [NeteaseAPI docs](https://binaryify.github.io/NeteaseCloudMusicApi/#/?id=%e5%ae%89%e8%a3%85) for more details).

You can also deploy to vercel yourself, check the official docs for instructions.
#### Installation
```
git clone git@github.com:Binaryify/NeteaseCloudMusicApi.git
cd NeteaseCloudMusicApi
npm install
```
#### Hosting
In the NeteaseCloudMusicApi directory: 
```
node app.js
```
Self-hosting means that the server has to be running at http://localhost:3000 (the default port) when using the extension, don't close it!

#### Applying Change
Last, in order for you to use the locally hosted api for fetching, change all instances of "https://netease-cloud-music-api-patrick-orz.vercel.app/" in the source code into "http://localhost:3000/".

## Installation
Download [popupLyricsPlus.js](https://github.com/Patrick-orz/PopupLyrics-Plus/blob/main/popupLyricsPlus.js) from the main branch (not from /Archive!!), and place into the Spicetify Extensions directory.

Spicetify paths are below.
|Platform|Path|
---------|-----
|Windows|%appdata%\spicetify\|
|Linux/MacOS|~/.config/spicetify|

Push extension into Spicetify and apply

```
spicetify config extensions popuplyricsplus.js
spicetify apply
```
